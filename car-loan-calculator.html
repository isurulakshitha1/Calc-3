      <h2>Understanding the Calculator Fields</h2>
      <p>To get the most accurate estimate, it helps to understand what each input means.</p>
      <dl class="definitions-list">
        <dt>Loan Amount</dt>
        <dd>This is the total price of the vehicle you wish to purchase. It's sometimes called the "sticker price" or the negotiated price before any down payment.</dd>
        
        <dt>Down Payment</dt>
        <dd>This is the initial amount of money you pay upfront. A larger down payment reduces the amount you need to borrow, which can lower your monthly payment and the total interest you pay.</dd>

        <dt>Annual Interest Rate (APR)</dt>
        <dd>This is the cost of borrowing the money, expressed as a yearly percentage. Your credit score is the biggest factor that determines your interest rate. A higher score typically means a lower rate.</dd>

        <dt>Loan Term</dt>
        <dd>This is the length of time you have to repay the loan, typically in years. A shorter term (like 3 or 4 years) means higher monthly payments but less interest paid overall. A longer term (like 6 or 7 years) lowers your monthly payment but means you'll pay more in total interest.</dd>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How much should I put down on a car?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Financial experts often recommend a down payment of at least 20% for a new car and 10% for a used car. A larger down payment helps reduce your monthly payments, builds equity faster, and minimizes the risk of being "upside down" on your loan (owing more than the car is worth).</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is a good interest rate for a car loan in 2025?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Interest rates vary based on your credit score and current market conditions. As a general guide for 2025, a score of 720 or higher (excellent credit) might get you an APR of 5-7%. A score between 660-719 (good credit) might see rates of 7-9%. Rates for scores below 660 will typically be higher.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I get a car loan with bad credit?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, it is possible to get a car loan with a low credit score. However, you should expect to pay a significantly higher interest rate. Lenders may also require a larger down payment or a co-signer to approve the loan. It's important to use the calculator to see how a higher APR affects your total cost.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Does this calculator work for all car types?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. You can use this calculator for any type of vehicle, whether it's a new or used sedan, SUV, truck, or an electric vehicle (EV). The loan principles are the same regardless of the car's fuel type.</div>
