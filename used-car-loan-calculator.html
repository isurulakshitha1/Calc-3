      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions for Used Car Loans</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Are interest rates higher for used cars?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Often, yes, but not always. Lenders see older cars as having a less predictable value, which can represent a slightly higher risk. This may result in an interest rate that is 0.5% to 1% higher than for a brand-new car. However, with an excellent credit score, you can still secure a very competitive rate.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How does a car's age or mileage affect the loan?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Lenders have limits on the age and mileage of vehicles they will finance. For example, a bank might not offer a 7-year loan on a 10-year-old car. A vehicle with very high mileage may also qualify for a shorter loan term or a higher interest rate, as its long-term reliability is less certain.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Should I get a pre-purchase inspection?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. A pre-purchase inspection (PPI) from a trusted independent mechanic is one of the smartest investments you can make when buying a used car. It can reveal hidden problems that could lead to expensive repairs down the road, giving you leverage to negotiate the price or the confidence to walk away from a bad deal.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do I need an extended warranty for a used car?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">An extended warranty (also called a vehicle service contract) is optional insurance that covers certain repairs after the manufacturer's warranty expires. It can provide peace of mind, especially on older or less reliable models. However, be sure to read the fine print to understand what is covered and what is not before you purchase one.</div>
