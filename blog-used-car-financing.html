      <h1>7 Tips for Financing a Used Car</h1>
      <p>Buying a used car can save you money—but financing it smartly is key to getting the best deal. Here are 7 expert tips to lower your interest rate, reduce your EMI, and avoid hidden costs when financing a pre-owned vehicle.</p>

      <h2>1. Know Your Budget & Credit Score</h2>
      <p>Before shopping, check your credit score. Scores above 700 typically qualify for the best used-car loan rates. Also, calculate what monthly EMI you can comfortably afford—aim for less than 15% of your take-home pay.</p>

      <h2>2. Shop Around for Rates</h2>
      <p>Don’t settle for the first offer. Compare rates from banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Even a 0.5% lower rate on a 5-year loan of $20,000 can save you hundreds in interest.</p>

      <h2>3. Maximize Your Down Payment</h2>
      <p>A larger down payment reduces your principal and lowers your EMI. Aim for at least 20% down; this also protects you from being upside-down if the car’s value drops faster than your payments.</p>

      <h2>4. Check for Prepayment Penalties</h2>
      <p>Before signing, ask if your loan has early repayment fees. A small penalty (1-2% of remaining balance) may still be worth it if you plan to refinance or pay off your loan early.</p>

      <h2>5. Consider Loan Term Carefully</h2>
      <p>Shorter terms raise your monthly payment but cut total interest. Weigh a 3-year vs. 5-year loan: the shorter term saves you money overall.</p>

      <h2>6. Use Our Used Car Loan Calculator</h2>
      <p>Enter your details into our <a href="used-car-loan-calculator.html">Used Car Loan Calculator</a>—it automatically factors down payment, interest rate, and term to show your EMI, total interest, and amortization schedule.</p>

      <h2>7. Refinance When Rates Drop</h2>
      <p>Market rates change. Use our calculator again after 12-18 months to see if refinancing could reduce your EMI or term, saving you thousands.</p>
