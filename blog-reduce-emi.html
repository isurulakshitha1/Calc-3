      <h1>Car Loan Eligibility Checklist: Are You Ready to Apply?</h1>
      <p>Thinking of applying for a car loan? Before you do, make sure you meet the key eligibility criteria. Here's a simple checklist to help you prepare and boost your approval chances.</p>

      <h2>1. Age Requirement</h2>
      <p>Most banks require applicants to be at least 21 years old and not older than 60 at loan maturity.</p>

      <h2>2. Employment Status</h2>
      <p>You must have a stable job or business. Salaried employees should have at least 1 year of work experience, and self-employed individuals usually need 2–3 years of business proof.</p>

      <h2>3. Income Level</h2>
      <p>The minimum monthly income is typically ₹15,000–₹20,000 (or equivalent in your country). The higher your income, the higher the loan you can get.</p>

      <h2>4. Credit Score</h2>
      <p>A credit score of 700+ is ideal. Check your score beforehand and correct any errors. Lower scores may still qualify but with higher interest rates.</p>

      <h2>5. Debt-to-Income Ratio</h2>
      <p>Lenders check how much of your income goes to paying existing debts. A lower ratio (under 40%) improves your chances of approval.</p>

      <h2>6. Documents Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proof of identity (Aadhaar/passport/license)</li>
        <li>Proof of address (utility bill/ration card)</li>
        <li>Income proof (payslips, ITRs)</li>
        <li>Bank statements (last 3–6 months)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Down Payment Preparedness</h2>
      <p>Having a decent down payment (15–20%) not only boosts approval but also lowers EMI and total interest.</p>

      <h2>8. Loan Tenure Preference</h2>
      <p>Be clear about how long you want to repay the loan. Shorter tenure = lower interest but higher EMI. Use our <a href="car-loan-emi-calculator.html">EMI Calculator</a> to test what works best for you.</p>

      <h2>Final Tip</h2>
      <p>If you don’t meet one or two criteria, don’t panic. Some banks offer joint loans (with a spouse or parent), or may adjust interest rate. Talk to your lender before giving up.</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
