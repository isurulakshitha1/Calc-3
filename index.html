      {"@type":"Question","name":"What is EMI in car loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It's the fixed amount you pay monthly to repay your car loan, which includes both principal and interest components."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"How is car loan EMI calculated?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EMI is calculated using the formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1], where P is principal, R is monthly interest rate, and N is the number of monthly installments."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I prepay my car loan to reduce EMI burden?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, most lenders allow prepayment. You can either reduce your EMI amount while keeping the same tenure, or reduce the tenure while maintaining the same EMI amount."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"What factors affect my car loan EMI?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your EMI is affected by the loan amount, interest rate, loan tenure, and your down payment. A larger down payment reduces your loan amount and subsequently your EMI."}}
